# VRV-Security-Assignment
This Python script analyzes web server logs to count requests per IP, find the most accessed endpoint, and flag suspicious IPs with excessive failed logins. Results are displayed in the terminal and saved to log_analysis_results.csv. Provide a log file (sample.log), run the script, and get a quick activity and security summary.
